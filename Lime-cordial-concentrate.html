<h2>Lime cordial concentrate</h2>
<br>
Squeeze as many limes as you like. Add the zest from one in twenty limes.<br>
<br>
Weight the juice and add an equal weight of sugar. Add 1 teaspoon citric acid for every kilogram of sugar.<br>
<br>
Warm it gently on the stove, stirring constantly. It only needs to get
warm, enough heat only to dissolve the sugar. Leave it for an hour or
two before straining into bottles. You might need to put some in the
freezer if you want it to last for ages.<br>
