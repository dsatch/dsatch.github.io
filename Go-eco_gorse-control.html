If you don't want to use hormone sprays and also want to fertilise your
pasture, this is for you.&nbsp; Simply "dessicate" your gorse with
a&nbsp;strong&nbsp;solution of urea sprayed on the plant. Urea
costs
about $1
a kilogram, and you mix 4 kg with water to make 10 litres of spray.
Thats $4 for 10 litres, which is reasonably expensive, but if you want
to fertilise your pasture then killing the gorse is really for free!
The fertility will be concentrated in large "urine patches" where you
spray, but will disperse through the soil and pasture over time.<br />
      <big style="color: rgb(252, 187, 20);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caution:
You are making strong and potentially dangerous solutions. Please
follow these instructions carefully and be safe with this sprays use.
Use rubber gloves when handling the urea solution and wear protective
eyewear at all times when spraying. Wash skin that comes in contact
with the solution. (Note: I have not personally suffered&nbsp;any harm
from
getting the stuff on my skin, but I do need you to understand the
dangers- I will not be responsible for the way you use
the&nbsp;ingredients or spray solution. Do NOT get this stuff in your
eyes.)</span></big><br />
Urea is a nitrogen fertiliser and&nbsp;an organic substance. Urine
contains urea. It is also produced by petrochemical companies in bulk
for
fertiliser by reacting natural gas with air under pressure (air is
mostly made up of nitrogen and urea is 46% nitrogen). Urea dissolves
really well in water, and if you heat the water more can be dissolved.<br />
      <br />
First prepare the urea solution by dissolving 4kg in water to make 10
litres. You can mix up larger batches and store it in a drum with a
closed lid, but watch out for ammonia gas when you open the drum.
Ammonia gas is harmful and you must not inhale it. be very careful
opening the drum.<br />

      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100px; float: right; padding-left: 4px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

First the urea solution goes in the sprayer.<br />
      <br />
I mix 60-80 ml dishwashing detergent (depending on the strength) as a
surfactant, and some spray dye in to ensure even and thorough coverage.<br />
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phosphate</span></big><br />
I mix 200ml Phosphoric acid with the urea solution just before I go
spraying, and use all the spray up. The phosphoric acid may react with
the urea given time, I'm not sure of the chemistry here. I add
phosphoric acid because my soils are really phosphate deficient and
urea alone won't green up my grass. With a bit of phosphate, the grass
greens up wonderfully.<br />
Gorse usually grows in phosphate deficient soils, and if you increase
the soil fertility the gorse can't compete as well with the pasture and
becomes less abundant.<br />
I wash out my sprayer after use.<br />
      <br />
Gorse must be sprayed before it seeds. If the plants are getting bigger
mow them or cut them down and spray the regrowth. You will use a lot
less spray.<br />
      <br />
The key to success appears to be the time of year you spray. The peak
of summer is ideal, and choose sunny warm weather. The plant will be
transpiring and the stomata open. In these conditions they die very
quickly, usually
within a week. I like to spray in the middle of the day until the early
evening, and after the morning dew has evaporated.<br />
It acts as a contact herbicide and quickly kills the photosynthesising
parts of the plant it contacts. However the spray needs to "soak in" at
least 24 hours before it rains- the longer the better. You also need to
cover the gorse plant well with spray to kill it. Walk around the
plants when spraying so you get a good and even coverage, and spray the
plant until its well wetted. If you miss some this part of the plant
will stay alive, but
you can come back later to finish the job.<br />
      <br />
The gorse will begin to die and go brown within a few days. It rots
very rapidly due to the nitrogen increasing the rate of decay. Check
the plants in a couple of weeks and respray any green remaining.<br />
      <br />
Because this spray only kills what it comes into contact with it
doesn't kill the grasses surrounding your gorse. The grass foliage will
be a
bit burned but pasture comes away and grows fantastically well after
being sprayed, while the gorse dies.<br />

Please email me with your comments and experiences so I can incorporate
them into this page. During the summer of 2008/2009 I have refined this
method to this stage, but I'm sure it can be further improved.<br />
