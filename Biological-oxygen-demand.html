<h2>Dissolved oxygen</h2>
Our atmosphere is 20% oxygen (200,000 ppm) whereas pond water is seldom
more than 10 ppm (10 mg/l or 0.001%). Below 3mg/l and fish become
stressed, and die at less than 2 mg/l <a href="http://aquaplant.tamu.edu/faq/dissolved-oxygen/" target="_blank">*</a> <a href="https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/impacts/dissolved-oxygen" target="_blank">*</a>.
Oxygen saturation of water can be expressed as a percentage of the
greatest amount of oxygen that the water can hold. Surface pressure and
temperature influence saturation levels.<br>
<br>
<h2>Biological Oxygen Demand</h2>
Biological (also called Biochemical) Oxygen Demand (BOD) refers to the
amount of oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic material in
one liter of water were oxidized by bacteria and protozoa (ReVelle and
ReVelle, 1988) <a href="http://www.polyseed.com/misc/BODforwebsite.pdf" target="_blank">*</a>. Unpolluted natural water has a BOD of 5mg/l or less<a href="http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/waterq3/WQassess3f.html" target="_blank">*</a>.
Bacteria will break down this waste and consume oxygen in the process
and as dissolved oxygen levels are depleted, the water will become
unsuitable for aquatic organisms (e.g. fish) unless the oxygen is
replenished. High levels of readily-decomposeable organic material in
the water mean the bacteria count in the water will be high and their
oxygen demand will be high within any given space of time. Fresh
wastewater has high levels of organic matter, thus a high 5 day BOD
(e.g. 600 mg/l).<br>
<br>
Nitrates and phosphates in water bodies can contribute to high BOD
levels because they cause rapid algae and phytoplankton growth and this
biomass will decay, demanding oxygen in the process <a href="http://www.polyseed.com/misc/BODforwebsite.pdf" target="_blank">*</a> <a href="http://www.fondriest.com/environmental-measurements/parameters/water-quality/dissolved-oxygen/" target="_blank">*</a>.<br>
<br>
Oxygen dissolves into water mostly by diffusion from the atmosphere into the water surface <a href="https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/impacts/dissolved-oxygen" target="_blank">*</a> <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm" target="_blank">*</a>. Where a high BOD is present and oxygen is not being replenished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_%28environmental%29" target="_blank">aquatic hypoxia</a> occurs.<br>
<br>
<h2>Anaerobic conditions</h2>
Once dissolved oxygen in wastewater is depleted, anaerobic bacteria use
nitrates present in the watewater to decompose organic matter. This
process is known as denitrification and produces nitrogen gas, lowering
levels of N in the wastewater. Once all the nitrate is used, bacteria
reduces sulfate, producing sulphur gas. Both nitrate and sulfate are
nutrients required by plants, thus anaerobic decomposition is not
desireable if treated effluent is to be used for fertigating plants.<br>
<br>
Anoxic conditions in sediment reduce the rate of decomposition and
enrichment with organic material takes place. Because decomposition has
mostly not taken place, if exposed to an aerobic envirnment, settled
solids can be rapidly decomposed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Aerobic decomposition</h2>
Improving levels of dissolved oxygen in waste water is usually achieved
by aeration. Mechanical aerators include paddles and bubblers, with the
objective of circulating the water to improve diffusion of oxygen at
the water surface.<br>
<br>
Solids separation<br>
Vermicomposting digesters offer separation of solids from blackwater
and kitchen greywater at source. By separating the solid waste this
does not contribute to the oxygen demand in the liquid effluent.<br>
