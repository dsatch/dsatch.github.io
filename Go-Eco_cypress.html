<h1>Cypress species for plantation forestry
in Northland
</h1>

<br />

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">One of the
primary reasons why lusitanica cypress is not considered viable by the
forest
industry here in New Zealand is that radiata
pine regimes have been traditionally applied to the species, increasing
costs and lowering returns.&nbsp;
What is required is a cost
effective and appropriate silvicultural system for cypress, one
that&nbsp;demonstrates optumum returns and reduced costs.<br />

<br />

There are three key areas where radiata management lets cypress growers
down:<br />

i) Initial stocking;<br />

ii) Pruning technology and thinning techniques;<br />

iii) Rotation length, final crop stocking and target log diameters.<br />

<br />

I have developed a set of management skills </span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">designed to be simple
and foolproof</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">
and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">applicable
to
any scale of plantation.<br />

<br style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: rgb(255, 116, 35);" />

</span> <big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: rgb(255, 116, 35);">Establishment</big><br style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;" />

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
optimum regime
starts with planting a high stock density. Trees must be planted at a
density
of at least 1700 stems per hectare.<br />

<br />

Radiata pine costs around $1000-$1500 a hectare to prepare, plant and
establish, while lusitanica costs around $2000-$2500 (at 1700 stems per
hectare).<br />

This is the only cost that is actually higher than for radiata. Pruning
and thinning costs with this initial stocking may actually be lower.
Research should focus on comparative studies to evaluate this.<br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(252, 187, 20);">Advantages:</span><br />

</span>
<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"></span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Straight stems, fine
branching;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">high
selection ratio from existing unimproved seedlines, thus ensurin</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">g retention
of only the most vigorous, well formed and canker-free stems;</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> </span></li>

</ul>

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> </span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"></span>
<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">much
less
toppling though the initial critical stages of establishment;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Much
lower risk of storm damage because the trees are gradually and
progressively
thinned, and traditional pruning/thinning regimes adopted from radiata
management leave trees open and exposed. The key to success is managing
lusitanica plantations for resilience;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Lower
pruning cost because only crop trees are pruned, and branching is finer;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Thinning
costs are reduced because thinning is undertaken at the same
time as pruning, by the pruner and with the same tools;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">High
stocking and upwardly competing trees means pruning and selection can
be delayed until appropriate.&nbsp;This is important
because under a traditional wider spaced regime, </span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">the
first pruning lift is "hit and miss" because it takes place prior to </span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">selection for vigour,
form and absence of canker;</span></li>

</ul>

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> </span>
<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
"window of opportunity" to prune and thin is extended and
management is proactive rather than reactive. There is much more room
for error- "followers" are always available to be pruned if necessary,
because they retain narrow form, small diameters and small branches;</span></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Cost-effective
pruning of up to 3m per lift can be achieved (5-6m for followers);</span></li>

</ul>

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> </span>
<ul>

  <li>Effective weed control achieved by fast closing
canopy. By
the
time pruning work is required, easy access is ensured, and thus lower
pruning costs.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

This video shows a gorse infested site planted at high stocking, and
ready for second pruning lift.
Note; only the best trees are pruned.<br />

</span><small><span style="color: rgb(234, 78, 0);"></span></small></big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Cypress trees have
abundant small branches which are very time consuming to prune off with
loppers, as used in pine tree pruning.<br />

I&nbsp;have developed a pruning saw which is very fast and easy to
use,
while not fatiguing the operator. This modified reciprocating saw is
demonstrated with this video.</span><br style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;" />

<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(234, 78, 0);"> <object height="388" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mKgHlVP7ZMM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />

<span style="color: rgb(255, 116, 35);">Thinning</span></span></big><br style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;" />

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Sudden
opening up of the canopy caused by excessive thinning can be very
detrimental to cypress plantations, resulting in toppling of prime crop
trees thus leaving gaps in the forest. This makes surviving trees more
vulnerable
to further storm damage.&nbsp;<br />

Thinning operations ideally should be
undertaken on a regular and gradual basis, which is expensive.<br />

Ringbarking of competing trees can be undertaken at the same time as
pruning, using the same modified reciprocating saw. Only trees directly
adjacent to and directly competing with
the crop tree being pruned
require ringbarking. During each pruning operation more trees are
ringbarked, thus ensuring a gradual and more natural "thinning" of the
forest. The trees remain standing and dead, and thus do not impede
access like felled thinning residues do. Easy access means fast
progress and significant cost savings.<br />

Not only are costs significantly reduced but
crown branch size is also
minimised above pruned log height by the progressive and gradual
reduction of stocking
densities. This means higher value top logs.<br />

</span><big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(234, 78, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 116, 35);">Final crop stocking</span></span></big><br />

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Final crop
stocking is the subject of much debate but I recommend a relatively
high stocking for two reasons: <br />

<br />

1.
Cypress trees are subject to wind damage and New Zealands winter
conditions of high winds and wet soils can lead to toppling of trees of
all ages. The low tree stockings required for long rotations and big
logs are particularly vulnerable, and vulnerability
increases with each thinning operation and the long time periods to
harvest. Forests thinned heavily for large diameters do not have
replacements for toppled trees and inevitably suffer from large gaps
and resulting reduction in yields;<br />

<br />

2. Sawmilling technology is becoming more and more
able to deal with small diameter logs. Closer spacing between trees
means smaller branching in the headlogs and thus more value even from
small diameters. <a href="http://www.hewsaw.com/">Hewsaws</a>
deal with
diameters
down to 8cm and with a maximum of 25cm. The <a href="http://www.woodproductsonlineexpo.com/content.php/116/2515/hewsaw_mobile_sawmill.html">R200
Mobile</a> HewSaw Sawmill can be used for processing small runs
of logs at various locations so is suitable for a smaller more
widespread resource. Industry needs to think ahead.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><br />

More research needs to take place on determining optimum log diameters
for
efficient production of sawn timber, thus leading to optimum rotation
lengths
and stocking densities. This is an important and
clear research priority which will&nbsp;clarify the economics for
industry. Results may just be surprising. There has been some
historical work (see below) but this has not yet&nbsp;produced
valid results for industry.<br />

<br />

Small diameter cypress logs can be sawn with good yields. I would
suggest that aiming for a 20 year
rotation with 400-500 stems per hectare is appropriate, and will
produce higher
annual returns than radiata. Something for industry to think about...<br />
